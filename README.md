# language_learning_app
This is a basic language learning application made as an exercise project as a part of Angela Yu's flutter app development course.
 
It involves questions/statements regarding the French language along with bits of its grammar and slang whose reponse is a simple 'vrai' (true) or 'non' (false). When a user gets the answer right, they get a point along with a 'C'est bien!' (This is good!) and if they get it wrong, they lose a point along with getting a 'N'inquiete pas!' (Don't worry!). I have made adjustments to the code that was taught in the tutorials of the course as per my requirements. Check it out!
